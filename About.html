    <p>COOKIE POLICY
We use cookies to make our websites more user-friendly. Find out about the main types of cookies we use, and what we use them for.</p>

<p>(Updated 26 June 2018)</p>


<p>We use cookies principally because we want to make our websites and mobile applications user-friendly, and we are interested in anonymous user behaviour. Generally our cookies don't store sensitive or personally identifiable information such as your name and address or credit card details.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that our websites use cookies to store personal information about you, Pearson encrypts the personal data to prevent unauthorised use by anyone else</p>

<p>Here's a list of the main types of cookies we use, and what we use them for. We've described them using the categories recommended by the International Chamber of Commerce in the ICC UK Cookie Guide.</p>
<p>(When we mention "cookies", we also mean web beacons and other technologies that collect information in a similar way to cookies on websites or emails. When we mention "websites", we also mean mobile applications and emails.)
</p>
<p>Pearson's cookies typically contain:

a unique name set by the site that generated it
a value - the information within it that recalls your previous activities
an expiration date, which determines how long the cookie will remain active in your browser before being automatically deleted.</p>
